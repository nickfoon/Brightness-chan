# Brightness-chan
A simple (and quite useless) powershell script that changes the brightness of laptops (windows) to an exact amount.

There are three easy ways to run this (and any other powershell) script, the easiest is by simply opening the script (which should automatically run it), the second is to right click the file and select 'Run with Powershell', and the third is to run the script from the powershell console.

Note, this has only been tested on laptops, so I'm not 100% sure how it would react on a desktop or a laptop connected to monitor(s).
