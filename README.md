# Brightness-chan
A simple (and quite useless) powershell script that changes the brightness of laptops (windows) to an exact amount.

There are three easy ways to run this (and any other powershell script) -
1. Double-click/open the script (which should automatically run it)
2. Right click the file and select 'Run with Powershell'
3. Run the script from the powershell console (cd to correct directory & run './brightness-chan.ps1'

Note, this has only been tested on laptops, so I'm not 100% sure how it would react on a desktop or a laptop connected to monitor(s).
